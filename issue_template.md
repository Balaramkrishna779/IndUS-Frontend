## Issue Description

Package `file_picker` references itself as the default plugin for various platforms (linux, macos, windows), but it does not provide an inline implementation. This causes issues when trying to use the package.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Add `file_picker` package to your Flutter project.
2. Attempt to use the package on linux, macos, or windows platforms.
3. Observe the error message indicating the lack of an inline implementation.

## Expected Behavior

The package should either avoid referencing a default implementation via `platforms: linux: default_package: file_picker` or provide an inline implementation via `platforms: linux: pluginClass` or `dartPluginClass`.

## Actual Behavior

The package references itself as the default plugin but does not provide an inline implementation, leading to errors.

## Suggested Fix

Please either:
1. Avoid referencing a default implementation via `platforms: linux: default_package: file_picker`, or
2. Add an inline implementation to `file_picker` via `platforms: linux: pluginClass` or `dartPluginClass`.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
